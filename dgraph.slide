* What is DGraph

- Open Source
- Native, Distributed, Low latency, High throughput Graph Database
- Written in Go-lang
	- Highly Concurrent (go-routines, channels)
	- Performance similar to C++
	- Compiled and does not require specific environments to run on

* Motivation

- Usage of graph databases has grown significantly in a world where *Big*Data* is now a common term. 
- Applications in 
	- Social networks
	- User behaviour analysis
	- E-commerce recommendations
	- Internet of things
	- Medical and DNA research
	- Search engines

* Problem Statement

- Making an existing open-source graph database project DGraph to support distributed operation
	- Support distributed data loading
	- Support communication among the servers 
	- Minimise the network calls made to process a query

* Overview
	
- Graph data structures store objects and the relationships between them

- Relational databases : Large number of table joins to find the relationships. Compute time required increases as the number of results increases
- Graph databases store the relationships as first class citizens. Accessing connections is an efficient, constant-time operation

* Background

- Flatbuffers
- RDF
- Sharding
- GraphQL

* Flatbuffers

- Efficient cross-platform serialisation library created by Google for performance critical application
- DGraph uses Flatbuffers for all the communication, storage and internal representation.
- Characteristics of Flatbuffers which make it very useful are:
	- Access to serialised data without processing or unpacking
	- Memory efficiency and speed
	- Strongly typed 

* RDF

- Resource Description Framework
- DGraph's input is in RDF format
- Effective format to represent *Subject-Predicate-Object* relationships
- A sample RDF line
	<Alice>	<friendof>	<Bob>	.
- A real world dataset would have millions if not billions of such lines which represent the connections

* Sharding

- Partitioning of a dataset into multiple data chunks based on some mathematical function
- *Types*of*sharding* 
- *Range-based*sharding* : where the different ranges of the dataset are mapped to different shards
- *Modulo*sharding* : where the key name is passed to a hash function to get an integer and this integer’s Modulo with the number of shards

* GraphQL
- Is a query language and execution engine developed at Facebook
- Limited support. Lexing and parsing done by DGraph to convert into internal query representation
- By v1.0, most features of GraphQL would be supported
- Example : Query for genre of all the movies directed by Steven Spielberg
.code query.gql

* Centralised Version

* Making it Distributed

- Split loader into 2 phases : UID Assigner and Loader
- Enable communication among servers through RPC and tcp connection pools
- Batch writes which reduce the run-time of Loader

* Distributed Version

* Query processing

- GraphQL query received. Parsed into internal query representation
- Make network calls to process the query (linearly proportional to number of predicates/attributes)
    type SubGraph struct {
      Attr     string
      Children []*SubGraph
      query  []byte
      result []byte
    }
* Query processing

Subgraph format
.code subgraph

* Freebase Film Dataset

- Freebase is an online collection of structured data
- Includes information about 478,936 actors, 98,063 directors, films produced worldwide, genres, ratings
- Some examples of the predicates in Freebase film data are :
	- type.object.name.en : Connects the object to its English name
	- film.actor.film : Connects an actor to the film objects he has acted in
- Some example of entries in the dataset are :
	- <m.0102j2vq> <film.actor.film> <m.011kyqsq> .
	- <m.050llt> <type.object.name> "Aishwarya Rai Bachchan"@hr .
	- <m.0bxtg> <type.object.name> "Tom Hanks"@es .

* Evaluation 

- Was done on GCE (Google Compute Engine) instances

- *Metrics* 

	- Throughput
	- Latency [mean, 50 and 95 percentile]

- *Parameters* 

	- Number of nodes in a cluster
	- Number of parallel connections
	- Number of cores in an instance

- *Queries*
	- The queries used to test the performance were about 478,936 Actors and 98,063 Directors
	- For each request, a query is randomly chosen

* Fine Grained Locks

- Locks are obtained over individual posting lists and not over the entire database
- Concurrent access to different posting lists could be made which increases the throughput
- When the queries are varied, the performance gets better

* Results

- As the cumulative computational power that is available increases, the performance of the database is better
- The recommendation for running DGraph would be:
	• Use as many cores as possible
	• Have the servers close by geographically so that network latency is reduced
	• Larger sized RAMs are not a necessity in server but are important in case of
	loader
	• Distribute the data among servers and query them in a round-robin fashion for
	greater throughput

* Conclusions

- Performance of Distributed version is better under higher loads [A couple hundred parallel connections]
- A single machine can only handle so much
- Hence, horizontal scalability is important in modern databases and is supported through sharding

* Further Work

- Moving shards across machines
- Fault tolerance
- Replication
- Supporting GraphQL features
